\begin{solution}[10cm]
Newton's First Law states that an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by another force. Once the rocket ship sufficiently escapes the gravitational pull of the planets and Sun of our solar system, it no longer needs its thrusters to accelerate towards it destination. Instead, \emph{the rocket will continue flying through space at a constant speed and direction} until it comes into the vicinity of another star or planet, which will then alter the motion of the rocket via gravity. 
\end{solution}

\question[3] You are sitting on a jet plane on your way from San Francisco to New York City. While aboard the plane, the plane moves at a constant velocity of $\vb{v}=\SI{600}{mph}$ eastward. You take a coin and flip it directly upwards, after which is falls perfectly back in your hand. Explain in physics terms why the coin falls back into your hand rather than flying away from you at $\vb{v}=\SI{-600}{mph}$. 

\begin{solution}[1cm]
While you are a onboard a jet plane flying from San Francisco to New York at a steady speed of 500 mph westward, everything inside the train is moving at the same speed, including you and the coin in your hand. \textbf{Newton's First Law} states that an object's \textbf{inertia} keeps that object moving at the same speed and direction unless a new force acts upon it. So, when you flip the coin straight up, it doesnâ€™t suddenly stop moving westward. Instead, the coin keeps moving at 80 mph westward as it goes up and back into your hand, just as you and the train continue moving at 80 mph westward.

\question[3] You are on a spaceship deep in outer space, far away from any planets or stars (\textit{i.e.}, there is \textbf{no gravity}). In your large and otherwise empty spaceship, there are two unmarked, equally sized boxes floating next to you. One box is full of Q-tips, and the other is full of bricks. Explain how you can use Newton's Second Law to determine which box is full of Q-tips and which box is full of bricks. 

\begin{solution}[10cm]
Recall Newton's Second Law: 
\begin{align}
F = ma .
\end{align}
We know that if gravity \emph{was} acting upon the boxes, the box full of lead would weigh more than the box full of feathers. However, we also know (despite the absence of gravity) that lead is \emph{denser} than feathers, and thus the \textbf{mass} of the box of lead will be greater than the mass of the box of feathers, even in space. Rearranging Newton's Second Law in terms of the acceleration shows us that 
\begin{align}
a = \frac{F}{m}.
\end{align}
In other words, \emph{the larger the mass of the object, the smaller the acceleration will be}. We could thus propose an experiment: Give each box an identical push with the same force $F$. The box that accelerates \emph{less} will be the one with the greater mass. In our experiment, we would find that the box full of lead is harder to accelerate than the box of feathers because it has more mass.
\end{solution}

\question[3] You are building a house out of hay. With your acute physical senses, you have discerned that you need to apply \SI{3}{N} of force to accelerate one bale of hay at \SI{2}{m/s^2}. How much force would you need to accelerate 200 bales of hay at once at \SI{2}{m/s^2}?
\begin{solution}[1cm]
If the force required to accelerate a single brick at $a=\SI{1}{m/s^2}$ is $F_{brick}=\SI{1}{N}$, then the total force required to accelerate 100 bricks is
\begin{align*}
F_{total} = 100\times F_{brick} = 100 \times (\SI{1}{N}) = \boxed{\SI{100}{N}}

\question[3] A BART train going \SI{80}{mph} on the subway collides head on with a speck of dust. 
\begin{parts}
\part How do the forces on the BART train and the speck of dust compare?

\begin{solution}[5cm]
Newton's Third Law states that the force of the truck on the mosquito is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force of the mosquito on the truck. In symbols:
\begin{align*}
\vb{F}_{truck} = - \vb{F}_{mosquito}
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
\part How do their accelerations compare during the impact?

\begin{solution}[10cm]
Although the forces on the truck and mosquito are of equal strength, the accelerations are very different. Call the mass of the mosquito $m$ and the mass of the truck $M$. Both experience the same magnitude of force $F$, but the truck experiences a deceleration of 
\begin{align*}
a_{truck} = \frac{F}{M}
\end{align*}
while the mosquito experiences a deceleration of 
\begin{align*}
a_{mosquito} = \frac{F}{m}.
\end{align*}
Because $M \gg m$ (the mass of the truck is \textbf{much greater} than the mosquito's), the deceleration of the truck is \textbf{much less} than the mosquito's:
\begin{align*}
a_{truck} \ll a_{mosquito}.
\end{align*}
This is why the mosquito completely stops in its path and is squashed by the truck, but the truck keeps moving as if it had barely been budged at all from its path. 
\end{solution}

\question[3] You are on a tall ladder pushing upwards with all your might against the ceiling of the physics classroom. What is the action force? What is the corresponding reaction force?

The \textbf{action} is the force of your hands pushing on the wall. The \textbf{reaction} is the force of the wall pushing back on your hands. The action and reaction forces have equal magnitude, but opposite direction.

\textit{'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house... Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse....}\\
The Grinch has stolen all of the presents in Whoville! The Grinch has not thought his plan through very carefully, however, and now he needs to bring the presents back to his lair... He decides to employ his little dog Max to pull the sleigh. 
\question[2] While Max the dog pulls to the left, he creates a tension force $\vb{T}$ in the reigns of the sleigh. As the sleigh budges forwards on the snowy ground, the friction between the pavement and the bottom the sleigh generates a force $\vb{F_{fr}}$ opposing the motion of the sleigh. Draw arrows to represent the \textbf{four} forces acting on the sleigh below. Be sure to label each of the four forces as well.

\question[2] Use your result from the previous problem to calculate the magnitude of the normal force ($\vb{N}$) that must be supplied by the snowy ground to keep the sleigh from falling downwards through the Earth. Take the acceleration of gravity to be $g=\SI{10}{m/s^2}$.
\qsp
\question[2] Instilled with the strength of Christmas spirit, Max is able to pull with a force of $\SI{1200}{N}$, while the friction opposing his motion is $\vb{F_{fr}}=\SI{700}{N}$. What is the \textbf{net horizontal force} ($\sum \vb{F}$) on the sleigh?
