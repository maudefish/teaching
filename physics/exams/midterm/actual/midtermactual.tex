\question[3] Sonic the Hedgehog is running a marathon. Once he starts running, he is capable of accelerating at $\SI{3}{m/s^2}$ indefinitely. If he runs for 35 minutes, how far will he travel? (Hint: Convert minutes to seconds)

\question[3] Mr. Rodriguez is driving a 2007 Lincoln Town Car. To merge onto the freeway, he needs to raise his speed from $\SI{0}{m/s}$ to $\SI{30}{m/s}$ (which is approximately 65 mph). If the Lincoln can accelerate at $a=\SI{3.5}{m/s^2}$, how long does he need to keep the gas pedal floored to reach freeway speed?

\question[3] You are on a spaceship deep in outer space, far away from any planets or stars (\textit{i.e.}, there is \textbf{no gravity}). In your large and otherwise empty spaceship, there are two unmarked, equally sized boxes floating next to you. One box is full of feathers, and the other is full of solid lead. Explain in \textbf{2-3 complete sentences} how you can perform a simple experiment while exploiting Newton's Second Law to determine which box is full of feathers and which box is full of lead.
