% Math is the language of physics. Although the scope of this course will be largely \emph{qualitative} (\emph{i.e.} conceptual), we will need to have a certain level of mathematical fluency under our belts in order to describe the universe around us. Physics is by nature a \emph{quantitative} science--- in other words: numbers are necessary to accurately and precisely depict the world around us. 

In your algebra course, you have learned how to solve equations for a particular variable. For example, you have undoubtably encountered many problems of the form,  
\exampleBox{
\emph{Solve the following equation for $x$:} 
\begin{align*}
2x + 6 = 10. 
\end{align*}
}{How do we do it? Well, we may either stare at the equation long enough and guess the solution (Think: \emph{``What number when doubled and added to six gives ten?''}), or we may fall back and the tried and true algebraic manipulations you have mastered in your math courses. The fundamental rule in solving any equation is, as always:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{All mathematical operations must be applied to both sides of the equation.}
\end{enumerate}
To wit: 
\begin{align*}
2x + 6 &= 10 & & \text{(write down the problem)} \\
2x &= 4 & & \text{(subtract 6 from both sides)} \\
\Aboxed{x &= 2.} & & \text{(divide both sides by 2)} 
\end{align*}
It is always good practice to box your final answers.}
