% Math is the language of physics. Although the scope of this course will be largely \emph{qualitative} (\emph{i.e.} conceptual), we will need to have a certain level of mathematical fluency under our belts in order to describe the universe around us. Physics is by nature a \emph{quantitative} science--- in other words: numbers are necessary to accurately and precisely depict the world around us. 
\section*{Single Variable Equations}
In your algebra course, you have learned how to solve equations for a particular variable. For example, you have undoubtably encountered many problems of the form,  
\qsp

\exampleBox{
\emph{Solve the following equation for $x$:} 
\begin{align*}
2x + 6 = 10. 
\end{align*}
}{How do we do it? Well, we may either stare at the equation long enough and guess the solution (Think: \emph{``What number when doubled and added to six gives ten?''}), or we may fall back and the tried and true algebraic manipulations you have mastered in your math courses. The fundamental rule in solving any equation is, as always:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{All mathematical operations must be applied to both sides of the equation.}
\end{enumerate}
To wit: 
\begin{align*}
2x + 6 &= 10 & & \text{(write down the problem)} \\
2x &= 4 & & \text{(subtract 6 from both sides)} \\
\Aboxed{x &= 2.} & & \text{(divide both sides by 2)} 
\end{align*}
It is always good practice to box your final answers.}
\qsp
Now give it a try yourself:
\begin{questions}

\question Solve $2x-4 = 2$ for $x$. 
\ifprintanswers
\begin{solution}
\begin{align*}
2x - 4 &= 2 & & \text{(write down the problem)} \\
2x &= 6 & & \text{(add 4 to both sides)} \\
\Aboxed{x &= 3.} & & \text{(divide both sides by 2)}
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
\else
\qsppp
\fi

\question Solve $4x - 9 = 7$ for $x$.
\ifprintanswers
\begin{solution}
\begin{align*}
4x - 9 &= 7 & & \text{(write down the problem)} \\
4x &= 16 & & \text{(add 9 to both sides)} \\
\Aboxed{x &= 4.} & & \text{(divide both sides by 4)}
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
\else
\qsppp
\fi

\question Solve $6x - 3 = 3x + 9$ for $x$.
\ifprintanswers
\begin{solution}
\begin{align*}
6x - 3 &= 3x + 9 & & \text{(write down the problem)} \\
3x - 3 &= 9 & & \text{(subtract $3x$ from both sides)} \\
3x &= 12 & & \text{(add 3 to both sides)} \\
\Aboxed{x &= 4.} & & \text{(divide both sides by 3)}
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
\else
\qsppp
\fi
\end{questions}
\section*{Double Variable Equations}
Oftentimes in physics problems, there is more than one variable involved. If there are two --- call them $x$ and $y$ --- we might refer to them as \emph{independent} and \emph{dependent} variables, respectively. The naming convention reminds us that $y$ depends on $x$; if we change $x$, we expect $y$ to change as well. 

In a science experiment, for example, $x$ might represent the amount of water given each day to a plant in mL (milliliters), while $y$ might represent the height of the plant in cm (centimeters). 
\qsp
\exampleBox{
\emph{Solve for $y$. Then interpret the physical meaning of the equation:} 
\begin{align*}
2y - 10x &= 20. 
\end{align*}
}{
\begin{align*}
2y - 10x &= 20 & & \text{(write down the problem)} \\
2y &= 10x + 20 & & \text{(add \( 10x \) to both sides)} \\
\Aboxed{y &= 5x + 10.} & & \text{(divide both sides by 2)}
\end{align*}
Because the equation takes the familiar $y=mx + b$ form, we could say that ``$y$ increases \textbf{linearly} with $x$.'' In the context of the scientific situation described above the example box, this equation might then be interpreted to be 
\begin{align*}
\Aboxed{\text{(height of plant in cm)} &= 5\times\text{(water given to plant in mL)} + 10.} 
\end{align*}
If we knew that a particular plant was given $x=\SI{5}{mL}$ of water, say, we could plug this into our equation to find the expected height of the plant: 
\begin{align*}
y &= 5(5) + 10.} & & \text{(plug in $x=5$)} \\
y &= 25 + 10 & & \text{(add the numbers)} \\
\Aboxed{y &= \SI{35}{cm}} & & \text({})} 
\end{align*}
}
